Problem
Design a URL verifier that decides if a given URL is safe to browse
or not.

Answer
URL is of following form:
[protocol/www, http][address][domain name]

1. Create a Trie structure for each domain.
2. Root of Trie is domain name itself.
3. Trie 1: [com]
4. Trie 2 [org]
5. Each trie has URL address stored in it.

This solution gives O(k) bound on search time and
is space optimized.
